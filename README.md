# stochastic-game-of-life
This repository contains several experiments on a stochastic version of Conway's Game of Life

**Note**: some experiments can last several hours (depending on the hardwere of the system).
The constant values of each experiment (probabilities, grid-size, time steps ecc...) sometimes are usually the same as the ones in the original paper (https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.54.R1025).
For faster, but not exact, replicability they can be changed.
